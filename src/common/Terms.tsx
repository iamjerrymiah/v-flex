                    How long do I have to return an item?
                    You have 14 days from the date of purchase to return an item(s). Item returns should be accompanied with a valid reason for return and or in original undamaged packaging where applicable. 
                    You are responsible for the cost of returning any items to our warehouse and we would always recommend receiving proof of postage in the event of any loss. <br />

                    Simply return your items to the following address within 14 days of the date on your dispatch note. Please note, that returns will be made at your own cost.

                    Can I have an exchange instead of a refund?
                    Yes, this may be possible, we assess this on a case by case basis and you will be required to pay additional delivery charges for all exchanges unless faulty. 
                    All inquiries should be directed via mail (to be provided) <br/>

                    What should I do if I receive an incorrect or faulty item?
                    We’re sorry to hear that you’ve received an incorrect or faulty item. Please contact us via the contact us form stating the order number or email  
                    (to be provided) with further details of the issue within 7 days of receiving your order. 
                    One of our customer service agents will be more than happy to look into this for you. <br />

                    How long does it take to process my return?
                    It can usually take up to 14 working days (excluding weekends and bank holidays) from the date of your return for your parcel to be delivered back to our warehouse and processed. 
                    On receiving your return the next step is for us to check the item(s). Once our checks are complete we’ll refund your credit/debit card. The funds should appear on your bank statement within 3-5 working days (how long depends on your card issuer). 
                    If you paid for your order with a gift voucher or store credit, this will be credited back to your account. We’ll make sure to keep you in the loop and send you an email as soon as your parcel arrives back at our warehouse, and again when we have processed your refund. 
                    If you paid via Billink or Klarna it may take up to 14 days for the refund to clear.
